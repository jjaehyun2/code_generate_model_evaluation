# Hybrid Code Generation Evaluation Framework
## Integrating LPcodedec Stylistic Analysis and StructCoder Structural Analysis

---

## Executive Summary

This repository presents a novel evaluation framework for code generation models that combines two cutting-edge methodologies: LPcodedec for coding style analysis and StructCoder for structural code analysis. The framework represents a significant advancement in code quality assessment by integrating statistical style features with deep structural understanding, providing comprehensive evaluation capabilities for modern code generation systems.

---

## Theoretical Foundations and Background

### 1. LPcodedec: Coding Style Feature Analysis

**LPcodedec** (LLM-Paraphrased Code Detection) is a groundbreaking approach introduced in "Detection of LLM-Paraphrased Code and Identification of the Responsible LLM Using Coding Style Features" [arXiv:2502.17749v1]. This methodology addresses the critical challenge of distinguishing between human-written and LLM-generated code through sophisticated stylistic analysis.

#### Core Principles of LPcodedec:

**Statistical Foundation**: The method is built upon rigorous ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) statistical analysis that identified significant differences between human-written and LLM-generated code across multiple programming languages (C, C++, Java, Python).

**Feature Design Philosophy**: LPcodedec extracts 10 quantitative features organized into three conceptual groups:
- **Naming Consistency** (4 features): Function, variable, class, and constant naming patterns
- **Code Structure** (3 features): Indentation consistency, function length, nesting depth
- **Readability** (3 features): Comment ratio, function name length, variable name length

**Empirical Validation**: The paper's ANOVA analysis revealed that **comment ratio** consistently exhibits the highest F-statistic across all programming languages, making it the most discriminative feature for detecting LLM-generated code.

**Language-Specific Insights**:
- **Python and C**: Readability features (especially comment ratio) are most effective
- **C++ and Java**: Code structure features dominate due to object-oriented complexity
- **Cross-language consistency**: Comment ratio remains universally significant

**Performance Characteristics**: LPcodedec achieves remarkable efficiency with 1,343× speedup compared to Tree Edit Distance while maintaining superior F1 scores (87-93% across languages).

### 2. StructCoder: Structure-Aware Code Analysis

**StructCoder** represents a paradigm shift in code analysis by moving beyond surface-level token sequences to capture deep structural semantics. This approach is inspired by structure-aware Transformer architectures that simultaneously model Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) and data flow graphs.

#### Fundamental Concepts:

**Multi-Dimensional Structural Analysis**: StructCoder analyzes code through five complementary perspectives:
- **AST Structural Features**: Node type distributions, tree depth, branching factors
- **Data Flow Graph Features**: Variable dependencies, def-use chains, scope analysis
- **Control Flow Features**: Conditional structures, loop patterns, cyclomatic complexity
- **Call Graph Features**: Function invocation patterns, built-in usage analysis
- **Dependency Features**: Variable scope relationships, local vs. global dependencies

**Architectural Innovation**: Unlike traditional approaches that treat code as linear text, StructCoder maintains explicit representations of program structure, enabling more accurate semantic similarity assessment.

### 3. CodeBLEU: Comprehensive Code Similarity Metric

**CodeBLEU** extends traditional BLEU metrics to address the unique characteristics of programming languages. It combines four complementary components:
- **N-gram Match**: Surface-level token similarity
- **Weighted N-gram Match**: Emphasizes programming keywords
- **AST Match**: Syntactic structure comparison
- **Data Flow Match**: Semantic correctness assessment

The final score is computed as: `CodeBLEU = α·BLEU + β·Weighted_BLEU + γ·AST_Match + θ·DataFlow_Match`

---

## System Architecture and Implementation

### Core Components Analysis

#### 1. LPcodedecAnalyzer Class

The `LPcodedecAnalyzer` class implements the complete feature extraction pipeline based on the original paper's methodology.

**Key Implementation Details**:

```python
class LPcodedecAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.naming_patterns = {
            'camelCase': re.compile(r'^[a-z][a-zA-Z0-9]*$'),
            'PascalCase': re.compile(r'^[A-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*$'),
            'snake_case': re.compile(r'^[a-z_][a-z0-9_]*$'),
            'UPPER_SNAKE_CASE': re.compile(r'^[A-Z_][A-Z0-9_]*$'),
        }
```

**Feature Extraction Process**:
1. **AST Parsing**: Utilizes Python's `ast` module for robust code analysis
2. **Naming Analysis**: Regex-based pattern matching for consistent style detection
3. **Structural Metrics**: Statistical analysis of code organization patterns
4. **Readability Assessment**: Comment density and identifier length analysis

**Critical Implementation Insight**: The code correctly prioritizes comment ratio (feature #8) as the most important feature, aligning with the paper's empirical findings.

#### 2. StructCoderAnalyzer Class

The `StructCoderAnalyzer` represents a sophisticated structural analysis engine that captures multi-dimensional code characteristics.

**Architectural Highlights**:

```python
def extract_structural_features(self, code: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # Five-dimensional analysis
    ast_features = self._extract_ast_structural_features(tree)
    dfg_features = self._extract_dataflow_features(tree)
    cfg_features = self._extract_control_flow_features(tree)
    call_graph_features = self._extract_call_graph_features(tree)
    dependency_features = self._extract_dependency_features(tree)
```

**Advanced Analysis Techniques**:
- **AST Node Distribution**: 38 distinct node types with frequency analysis
- **Data Flow Tracking**: Variable lifecycle and dependency chain analysis
- **Control Flow Complexity**: Cyclomatic complexity with nested structure detection
- **Call Graph Construction**: Function invocation pattern analysis
- **Scope-Aware Dependency Analysis**: Multi-level variable relationship tracking

#### 3. LPStructHybridEvaluator Class

The hybrid evaluator represents the core innovation of this framework, implementing a weighted combination of stylistic and structural analyses.

**Weighting Strategy**:
```python
def __init__(self, style_weight: float = 0.5, structural_weight: float = 0.5):
    # Configurable weighting allows domain-specific tuning
    self.style_weight = style_weight / total_weight
    self.structural_weight = structural_weight / total_weight
```

**Multi-Level Similarity Computation**:
- **Style Similarity**: Cosine similarity of 10-dimensional LPcodedec features
- **Structural Similarity**: Weighted combination of 5 structural aspects
  - AST similarity: 40% weight (most important)
  - Data flow similarity: 30% weight (StructCoder's core innovation)
  - Control flow similarity: 20% weight
  - Call graph similarity: 7% weight
  - Dependency similarity: 3% weight

#### 4. ModelCodeGenerator Class

The code generation component integrates with Hugging Face Transformers for practical evaluation scenarios.

**Generation Strategy**:
- **Sampling Parameters**: Temperature=0.8, top_p=0.95 for balanced creativity/quality
- **Diversity Mechanisms**: `no_repeat_ngram_size=3` prevents repetitive outputs
- **Post-processing**: Intelligent code cleaning and formatting

---

## Evaluation Methodology and Metrics

### Best-of-N Evaluation Protocol

The framework implements a sophisticated Best-of-N evaluation strategy that:
1. Generates multiple code candidates (typically N=3)
2. Evaluates each candidate against the reference using hybrid metrics
3. Selects the highest-scoring candidate
4. Provides comprehensive statistical analysis

### Statistical Analysis Framework

**Primary Metrics**:
- **Hybrid Score**: Weighted combination of style and structural similarities
- **Component Scores**: Individual style and structural similarity scores
- **Diversity Metrics**: Score variance and improvement quantification
- **Correlation Analysis**: Style-structure relationship assessment

**Advanced Analytics**:
```python

    'best_improvement': best_result['hybrid_score'] - np.mean(scores),
    'style_structural_correlation': np.corrcoef(style_scores, structural_scores)[0,1]
